# Download Persistence Implementation

## Problem Solved
Videos were being removed from the DownloadScreen when the app restarted because they were only stored in memory.

## Solution
Implemented persistent storage using **SharedPreferences** to save downloaded videos locally on the device.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Updated `lib/service/download_manager.dart`**

#### Added Persistence Features:
- **Import statements**: Added `dart:convert` and `shared_preferences`
- **Storage key**: `'downloaded_videos'` - used to store/retrieve data
- **Load on initialization**: Downloads are automatically loaded when DownloadManager is first created
- **Auto-save**: Every add/remove operation automatically saves to SharedPreferences

#### Key Methods:
```dart
// Load downloads from device storage
Future<void> _loadDownloads() async

// Save downloads to device storage  
Future<void> _saveDownloads() async

// Add video and persist
Future<bool> addDownload(Video video) async

// Remove video and persist
Future<void> removeDownload(int videoId) async

// Initialize and ensure data is loaded
Future<void> initialize() async
```

### 2. **Updated `lib/screens/start_training/start_training_screen.dart`**

#### Changes:
- Added `_initializeDownloadManager()` method in `initState()`
- Updated `_downloadVideo()` to use async `addDownload()`
- Updated `_deleteDownloadedVideo()` to use async `removeDownload()`
- Ensures DownloadManager is initialized before checking download status

### 3. **Updated `lib/screens/download_screen.dart`**

#### Changes:
- Added `_isLoading` state to show loading indicator
- Added `_loadVideos()` method to initialize DownloadManager
- Shows CircularProgressIndicator while loading downloads
- Properly handles empty state after loading completes

## How It Works

### Data Flow:

1. **App Starts**:
   - DownloadManager singleton is created
   - Automatically loads downloads from SharedPreferences
   - Parses JSON and converts to Video objects

2. **User Downloads Video**:
   - Video is added to in-memory list
   - List is converted to JSON
   - JSON is saved to SharedPreferences
   - Data persists on device

3. **User Deletes Video**:
   - Video is removed from in-memory list
   - Updated list is saved to SharedPreferences
   - Change persists on device

4. **App Restarts**:
   - DownloadManager loads saved data
   - All previously downloaded videos are restored
   - User sees their downloads immediately

### Data Storage Format:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Video Title",
    "video": "https://example.com/video.mp4",
    "image": "https://example.com/thumbnail.jpg",
    "subTitle": "Subtitle",
    ...
  },
  ...
]
```

## Benefits

✅ **Persistent Storage** - Downloads survive app restarts
✅ **Automatic Sync** - All changes are automatically saved
✅ **Fast Access** - Data loads quickly from local storage
✅ **No Backend Required** - Everything stored on device
✅ **JSON Format** - Easy to debug and maintain

## Testing

### Test Scenarios:
1. ✅ Download a video
2. ✅ Close and restart the app
3. ✅ Verify video still appears in Downloads
4. ✅ Delete a video
5. ✅ Restart app and verify deletion persisted
6. ✅ Download multiple videos
7. ✅ Restart and verify all videos are present

## Technical Notes

### SharedPreferences Limitations:
- **Storage limit**: ~10MB (varies by platform)
- **Data type**: String-based (we use JSON)
- **Scope**: Per-app storage (not shared between apps)
- **Platform**: Works on iOS, Android, Web, Desktop

### Current Implementation:
- Stores video **metadata** only (not actual video files)
- Video files are still streamed from network
- Suitable for tracking download status

### For True Offline Support:
To actually download and play videos offline, you would need to:
1. Download video files to device storage
2. Use `path_provider` to get local storage paths
3. Save file paths in SharedPreferences
4. Update VideoPlayer to use local files
5. Handle storage permissions
6. Implement download progress tracking

## Future Enhancements

1. **Migration to Hive/SQLite** - For better performance with large datasets
2. **Download Video Files** - Actually save videos to device
3. **Storage Management** - Track and manage storage usage
4. **Sync Across Devices** - Cloud backup of download list
5. **Expiry Dates** - Auto-remove old downloads
