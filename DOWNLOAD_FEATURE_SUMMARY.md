- Videos are stored in memory (not persisted to disk)
- Downloads are lost when app is closed

### For Production:
To make this production-ready, you'll need to:

1. **Implement Real Downloads:**
   ```dart
   // Add to pubspec.yaml
   dependencies:
     dio: ^5.0.0
     path_provider: ^2.0.0
     permission_handler: ^10.0.0
   ```

2. **Download to Device Storage:**
   - Request storage permissions
   - Download video files to local storage
   - Save file paths in local database (SQLite/Hive)
   - Update DownloadManager to persist data

3. **Track Download Progress:**
   - Show progress percentage
   - Allow pause/resume functionality
   - Handle network errors and retries

4. **Play Offline Videos:**
   - Update VideoPlayerController to use local file paths
   - Handle both online and offline video sources
